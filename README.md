This project contains a Cloudflare Worker to block all bypass attempts of LootLabs content locker links by using the redirect API and referrer blocking, as well this has some analytics tracking.

Currently this uses a KV to track the analytics, if you get too many clicks this will go over the cloudflare free tier, I will soon add an option to disable the analytics.

## Setup & Deployment

1. Deploy the [Worker](https://github.com/kbdevs/lootlabs-antibypass/blob/main/SETUP.md)
